    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A quick recipe I thought up while trying to decide what to eat for breakfast. Great if you are trying to figure
        out what to do with those blueberries in the fridge or freezer! Also great on-the-go! Delicious and includes
        many foods that are a great way to start your day! Many of the ingredients, except for the blueberries and
        yogurt, are optional and vary depending on your own taste. I love cinnamon and a thick, super-cold smoothie</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Greek Yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 ice cubes</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend blueberries, yogurt, orange juice, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a blender on low
            speed for 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Increase speed to high and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add ice and blend on high until smooth, about 1 minute more.</li>
    </ol>
