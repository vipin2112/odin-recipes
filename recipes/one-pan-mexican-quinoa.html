    <h2>Description</h2>

        With a fun Mexican twist, this dish is chockfull of so many amazing flavors, from the tangy lime juice to the
        hint of spiciness from the chili powder and jalapeno. And not only is this healthy and nutritious but it’s also
        unbelievably easy to make. Simply throw everything into the skillet and that’s it. Even the quinoa is cooked
        right in the pan, really letting the flavors soak in.
        Now who said healthy food has to be boring?
